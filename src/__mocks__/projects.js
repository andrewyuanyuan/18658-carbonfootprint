        'Plastic Bank builds ethical collection communities in vulnerable coastal areas. Community members collect plastic from the environment and exchange it at their local Plastic Bank branch for secure income and social benefits (such as health and work insurance, meal vouchers, cooking fuel). The collected material is then processed into Social Plastic® feedstock for reuse in products and packaging. Your contribution will support the local collection and recycling of ocean-bound plastic in Indonesia while improving lives of those who collect it through incremental income and social benefits. All exchanges are recorded through a blockchain-secured platform that enables traceable collection. You will receive a certification from Plastic Bank verifying the amount of kilograms collected from the environment..',

        'The Great Bear Forest Carbon Project (GBFCP), is the first carbon offset project in North America to be implemented on traditional territory with unextinguished Aboriginal rights and Title. The project increases carbon sequestration stocks through conversion to protected forests that were previously available for commercial logging. The Coastal First Nations (CFN) developed the project in collaboration with the BC Government and is located in the Great Bear Rainforest on the territories of its member nations, including Wuikinuxv, Heiltsuk, Kitasoo/Xai’xais, Nuxalk, Gitga’at, Gitxaala, Metlakatla, Old Massett, Skidegate and the council of the Haida Nation. Coastal old growth forests play an important role in capturing and storing vast amounts of carbon dioxide in the trees and soil, and the Great Bear Rainforest stores more carbon per hectare than any of the world’s tropical rainforests, including the Amazon. The Great Bear Rainforest contains the Spirit Bear (Kermode Bear—a rare subspecies of the American black bear with white fur), grizzly bears, cougars, wolves, salmon runs, etc. The Coastal First Nations are the project proponents and own the carbon offsets, and revenue generated from all sales go directly to the First Nations communities. Proceeds are used to generate environmental steward jobs in the communities, support community development, youth programs and seniors’ centres.',

The forests of Klawock Heenya have been utilized for centuries for subsistence uses such as firewood, housing materials, and canoe logs. From 1980 to 2015, nearly all the commercially operable timber on Klawock Heenya lands was harvested, narrowly preserving the areas of old growth that remain. Since then, natural regeneration has resulted in thriving second growth forests, with trees reaching up to twelve feet in diameter. The registration and management of this forest carbon project helps ensure the long-term sustainable governance, protecting and preserving the health and age of the forest.',

This particular project includes the installation of 33 wind turbines, with an installed capacity of 1,500kW each, the energy being supplied to Northwest China Power Grid (NWCPG). Thanks to this, we have a net annual estimate of electricity production and emission reduction for this project of 129,195 Mwh and 99,144 tCO2e, respectively. With this project, we have different types of benefits that we can find in its implementation, such as the reduction of CO2 emissions and the reduction of air pollution, due to the change in the use of fossil fuel combustion. Last but not least, the opportunities in the development of the local economy and employability, providing employment to the people of the territory in the different stages of the project, which will contribute to the local development of the region, allowing the economic growth of the local city. with expected income.',

The project is taking advantage of Asahan River flow that receives water from its natural source, Lake Toba. Geographically, the Project is located downstream of Lake Toba and upstream of the existing Asahan 2 (Siguragura) hydroelectric power plant, a large dam power plant built in 19811.',
